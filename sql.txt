   CREATE TABLE items (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       item TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

6. **Deploy the Application:** Copy the `app.py` and HTML templates to your EC2 instance. You'll need to install Python, Flask, and the `psycopg2` PostgreSQL adapter. Configure Apache to serve the application.

**IV. Important Security Considerations:**

* **Hardcoded Credentials:** Never hardcode sensitive information (database passwords, API keys) directly in your code. Use environment variables or a more secure secrets management solution.
* **Security Groups:** Restrict inbound and outbound traffic on your security groups to only necessary ports and IP addresses. The examples above use `0.0.0.0/0` for simplicity, but this is extremely insecure for production.
* **Publicly Accessible RDS:** Setting `publicly_accessible = true` is highly discouraged in production. Use a VPC and private subnets for better security.


This detailed outline provides a solid foundation for building and deploying your application. Remember to adapt and expand upon this to meet your specific requirements and security best practices. Always prioritize security in production environments.
